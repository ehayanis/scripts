Dear [User First Name or Team],

We are reaching out to inform you that your current API key used with JFrog Artifactory is set to expire in 10 days, as part of JFrog's platform-wide deprecation of API keys.

To ensure uninterrupted access to Artifactory, you must transition to using Identity Tokens instead of API keys.

üîÑ Why the change?
JFrog is deprecating API keys in favor of Identity Tokens, which offer improved security, manageability, and compliance with modern authentication standards.

üß≠ What you need to do:
Please follow these simple steps to generate and use an Identity Token:

Log in to your JFrog account

Generate an Identity Token

Replace the API key usage in your tools/scripts

Detailed instructions can be found in this guide:
üëâ How to Get an Identity Token in 3 Steps

‚è≥ Deadline:
Your current API key will expire on [Insert Date: 10 days from now].
Please complete the transition before this date to avoid disruptions.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to [your support team/contact info].

Thank you for your attention to this important update.
